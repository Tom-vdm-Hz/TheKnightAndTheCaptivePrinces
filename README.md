## Design patterns
When making code you always come across problems, to fix the most commmon issues we can use deisgn patterns. Design patterns are like blueprints we can apply to our code so we can improve the readability and structure of our code. There are a lot of different design patterns, each with a specific problem they fix.

For this project we chose three design patterns, we used the site [refactoring guru](https://refactoring.guru/) for most of our information on the patterns we used.

### Builder
The builder is a fairly straigh forward deisgn pattern, as it does exactly what its name implies. The builder buids complex objects in your code step by step, this helps you when want to make objects that are similar. 

The builder prevents that you have to make a giant constructor but instead you make a class called builder.
