## Design patterns
When making code you always come across problems, to fix the most commmon issues we can use deisgn patterns. Design patterns are like blueprints we can apply to our code so we can improve the readability and structure of our code. There are a lot of different design patterns, each with a specific problem they fix.

For this project we chose three design patterns, we used the site [refactoring guru](https://refactoring.guru/) for most of our information on the patterns we used.

### Abstract factory
With an abstract factory you can create multiple objects using an interface that creates families of connected classes. This makes it easier to create something that has similar features but aren't the same thing. 

In this project we used it to create the multiple characters as they had similar features getting hit, blocking attacks and attacking. 

### Bridge
The bridge is mainly used to split up large classes into 2 hierarchies 

### Observer

### State
